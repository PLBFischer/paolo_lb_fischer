## Research Experience  

**Research Assistant, Prof. Gootenberg & Prof. Abudayyeh — Harvard University**  
_Nov 2024 – Present_  

**Project 1**  
- Developed a new generative model architecture to forecast HSPC differentiation from sparse single-cell time-series data.  
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance across synthetic benchmarks and biological datasets.  
- Manuscript in preparation (co-first author).  

**Project 2**  
- Leading the development of a novel AI-driven computational pipeline for few-shot protein optimization.  
- Developing a diffusion-based method for data-efficient fine-tuning of protein foundation models.  
- Achieved 80-fold improvement in NanoLuc luminescence after testing only 60 protein variants.  

**Master’s Thesis, Prof. Mahadevan — Harvard University**  
_Mar 2024 – Nov 2024_  
- Designed a novel method to vascularize 3D-printed organs by leveraging the natural branching mechanisms of fluids injected into organ tissue.  
- Developed a high-performance finite element simulation of fluid branching with FEniCS in Python and identified material properties that enable the precise control of vascular structure.  
- Preprint under review at Physical Review Letters (co-first author). Preprint:
